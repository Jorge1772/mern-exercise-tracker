This app provides an introduction to making a full stack web application and performing CRUD operations using the MERN stack.

```
git clone
cd mern-exercise-tracker
yarn
cd client
yarn
cd ..
touch .env && touch .gitignore
```

Update your .env file so that it contains your unique MongoDB Atlas URI with the key ATLAS_URI, as in the `.env.sample` file.

Within your `.gitignore` file, add the following:

```
.env
node_mules
```

Run your front and back end servers concurrently using the `yarn dev` command.
